            <p>Classic Cheeseburger Perfection</p>
            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1.5 lbs of ground beef</li>
                <li>1 heaping tablespoon of sweet relish⁣</li>
                <li>1 Tablespoon of yellow mustard ⁣</li>
                <li>1 Tablespoon of kitchen bouquet browning sauce or soy sauce ⁣</li>
                <li>1 small white onion grated on a cheese grater or minced VERY finely</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon of celery salt</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
                <li>1 /2 tablespoon of garlic powder</li>
                <li>1/2 tablespoon of onion powder</li>
                <li>Cheese of your choice</li>
                <li>Buns of your choice</li>
                <li>lettuce, tomato, sliced onion and pickle</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Add your ground beef to a bowl, loosely break up the meat to make sure it is not in one big lump. This way you can season the meat evenly without having to mix it too much. Over mixed meat is what makes the burgers a strange texture.</li>
                <li>When you have your meat sort of spread out in the bowl loosely, sprinkle all the seasonings across the meat as if you were seasoning a steak. Then add the relish, mustard, kitchen bouquet and the grated onion.</li>
                <li>Mix the meat so that it is well combined, but do not over mix. Form four patties, make a dimple on the top of each. In the fridge for two hours, loosely covered. Each patty should be about 1/2 inch thick.</li>
                <li>When you are ready to cook, take the burgers out of the fridge 30 minutes before cooking and let sit out on the counter.</li>
                <li>Before cooking, make a little indentation (dimple) in the center of each burger with the back of a tablespoon. This helps the patty stay flat.</li>
                <li>When it is time to cook, get you skillet very hot with oil, but make sure the oil is not smoking. You can use a vegetable oil, or avocado oil.</li>
                <li>Add the burgers one at a time and cook for 6 minutes on each side. If yours are thinner they will need less time, if they are thicker than they will need more time. Make sure you are not pressing down on the burgers while they cook with your spatula. Just "set them and forget them" until it is time to flip them.</li>
                <li>You will know when it is time to flip them when they lift easily from the pan.</li>
                <li>At the end, add a slice of cheese to each one, and a couple tablespoons of water to the skillet, then cover so the cheese melts.</li>
                <li>Add your favorite burger toppings and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>

            <h1>Second Cheeseburger Recipe</h1>
            <h2>The Ultimate Smash Cheeseburger</h2>
            <img src="https://www.seriouseats.com/thmb/bHkv0XlGmRcD7JIwrE85oSIw3qc=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/20240304-SEA-Smashburger-AmandaSuarez-04-04c23462bc974ddf8d9fe1276630520c.jpg" alt="A smash burger with the cheese melting over the side with onions falling down from the burgers bun" height="250px" width="250px">
            <p>Same smash burger size, but twice the amount of crisp, browned crust.</p>
            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 soft hamburger roll, buttered and toasted</li>
                <li>Condiments and toppings as desired, such as mayonnaise, mustard, shredded lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and pickles</li>
                <li>4 ounces (110 g) freshly ground beef chuck, divided into 2 (2-ounce; 55 g) balls</li>
                <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 slice good melting cheese, such as American, cheddar, or homemade melting cheese</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare burger bun by laying toppings on bottom half of bun. Have it nearby and ready for when your burger is cooked.</li>
                <li>Preheat a large stainless steel sauté pan or skillet over high heat for 2 minutes. Place balls of beef in pan and smash down with a stiff metal spatula, using a second spatula to add pressure. Smashed patties should be slightly wider than burger bun.</li>
                <li>Season generously with salt and pepper and allow to cook until patties are well browned and tops are beginning to turn pale pink/gray in spots, about 45 seconds. Using a bench scraper or the back side of a stiff metal spatula, carefully scrape patties from pan, making sure to get all of the browned bits.</li>
                <li>Flip patties and immediately place a slice of cheese over 1 patty, then stack the second directly on top. Immediately remove from pan and transfer to waiting burger bun. Serve.</li>

            <h2>Stovetop Double-Stack Cheeseburgers</h2>
            <img src="https://www.simplyrecipes.com/thmb/5SNwgovIwVvZwbVyTv7A0RuEXlU=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__simply_recipes__uploads__2019__04__Stovetop-Cheeseburgers-hero1-3f2e37fc119441969f456f9a69042824.jpg" alt="A stovetop cheeseburger on a plate with lettuce and cucumbers" height="250px" width="250px">
            <p>Stovetop double-stack cheeseburgers have a generous amount of secret sauce. Don't forget a napkin!</p>
            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 cup mayonnaise</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon pickle relish</li>
                <li>20 to 24 ounces ground beef (90/10)</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, optional</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>4 to 8 slices American cheese</li>
                <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
                <li>Fresh lettuce</li>
                <li>Slices tomato</li>
                <li>Red onion</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Stir together the burger sauce ingredients, and adjust the flavors to your liking. Some people like more ketchup or more relish.</li>
                <li>Measure out ground beef into eight 3-ounce patties (for double cheeseburgers) or four 5- to 6-ounce patties (for single burgers). Some people even prefer a single, thin 4-ounce patty. Be gentle with the ground beef. Keep it in loose balls for now. Season the outside of the balls with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Preheat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add a drizzle of olive oil. Add the beef balls one at a time, pressing each one by covering it with foil and pressing down to flatten with a second small pan or skillet. Try to get the patty as even as possible. For double burgers, you are looking for a very thin patty. For single burgers, shoot for about 1/3-inch thick patty. Repeat with pressing each of the patties in the pan, reusing the same piece of foil.</li>
                <li>Cook patties for 2 minutes for the thinner double patties, or 3 to 4 minutes for the thicker single patties. Flip, top with cheese, and cook until the cheese is melted, another 2 to 3 minutes. The patties will shrink a bit as they cook. It’s okay to press on them a bit with your spatula to reshape them slightly, but try to keep a light touch, or you will push out all the juices.</li>
                <li>When your burger patties are cooked through and the cheese is very melted, smear the bottom bun with 1 to 2 tablespoons of burger sauce and top with lettuce. Add your burger patty (or patties) and top with sliced tomato and red onion.</li>
                <li>Serve immediately!</li>
            </ol>
