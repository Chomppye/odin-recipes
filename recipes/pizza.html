            <p>Here’s how to make authentic-tasting Chicago deep dish pizza. Complete with the buttery crust, slightly sweet tomato sauce, and a thick layer of cheese. </p>
            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>3 and 1/4 cups (406g) all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1/2 cup (60g) yellow cornmeal</li>
                <li>1 and 1/4 teaspoons salt</li>
                <li>1 Tablespoon (12g) granulated sugar</li>
                <li>2 and 1/4 teaspoons (7g) Platinum Yeast from Red Star instant yeast</li>
                <li>1 and 1/4 cups (300ml) slightly warm water</li>
                <li>1/2 cup (8 Tbsp; 113g) unsalted butter, divided 1/4 cup melted, 1/4 cup</li>
                <li>olive oil for coating</li>
                <li>2 Tablespoons (28g) unsalted butter</li>
                <li>1 small onion, grated (about 1/3 cup)*</li>
                <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
                <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
                <li>one 28-ounce can (794g) crushed tomatoes*</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon granulated sugar</li>
                <li>4 cups (about 16 oz) shredded mozzarella cheese*</li>
                <li>1/2 cup (45g) grated parmesan cheese</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Please use my step-by-step photos below this written out recipe as a guide to making the pizza. For best results and ease of mind, read through the recipe completely before beginning. You will need two deep dish 9×2-inch round cake pans if you are making both pizzas at the same time. You can also use 9-inch springform pans.</li>
                <li>For the crust: Combine the flour, cornmeal, salt, sugar, and yeast in the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. If you do not have a stand mixer, use your hand mixer and a very very large bowl. If you do not have any mixer, you will do this all by hand. Again, use a very large bowl. Give those ingredients a quick toss with your mixer on low or with a large wooden spoon. Add the warm water and 1/4 cup of melted butter. The warm water should be around 90°F (32°C). Make sure it is not very, very hot or it will kill the yeast. Likewise, make sure the butter isn’t boiling hot. If you melt it in the microwave, let it sit for 5 minutes before adding. On low speed, beat (or stir) the dough ingredients until everything begins to be moistened. Continuing on low speed (or remove from the bowl and knead by hand if you do not own a mixer), beat the dough until it is soft and supple and gently pulls away from the sides of the bowl and falls off of the dough hook- about 4-5 minutes. If the dough is too hard (it will be textured from the cornmeal), but if it feels too tough, beat in 1 teaspoon of warm water. Alternatively, if it feels too soft, beat in 1 Tablespoon of flour.</li>
                <li>Remove the dough from the bowl and form into a ball. Lightly grease a large mixing bowl with olive oil and place the dough inside, turning it around so that all sides of the dough are coated in the oil. Cover the bowl tightly with aluminum foil and allow to rise in a warm environment for 1-2 hours or until double in size.</li>
                <li>Once the dough is ready, lightly flour a large work surface. Remove dough from the bowl, set the bowl and aluminum foil aside (to use later). Gently punch down the dough to remove any air bubbles and roll the dough into a large 15×12-inch rectangle. Spread 1/4 cup of softened butter on top of the dough. Roll it up lengthwise per the photos below. Cut the dough log in half. Form the two pieces of dough into balls and place back into your greased bowl. Cover with aluminum foil and allow to rise in the refrigerator (not in a warm place) for 1 hour until they are puffy as you make the sauce.</li>
                <li>For the sauce: Place butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat and allow it to melt. Once melted, add the grated onion, salt, oregano, and red pepper flakes. Once the onion has slightly browned after about 5 minutes, add the garlic, tomatoes, and sugar. Turn the heat down to low-medium and allow it to simmer until it’s hearty, fragrant, and thick- about 30 minutes. You’ll have about 2 and 1/2 cups of sauce at this point. If you have more than that, keep simmering until the amount has reduced. Remove from heat and set aside until ready to be used. You may store the sauce in a tightly covered container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days if planning to make the pizza another day. You may freeze this sauce for up to 2 months as well.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 425°F (218°C).</li>
                <li>Assemble the pizzas: After the dough balls have risen in the refrigerator, they should be puffy. Keep one ball of dough in the refrigerator as you work with the first one. Roll it out on a lightly floured work surface, working it into a 12-inch circle. Using your rolling pin as a guide (see photos below), place over a 9×2-inch deep dish cake pan. Using your fingers, press the dough into the cake pan. Make sure it is nice and tight fitting inside the pan. Trim any excess dough off the edges with a small knife. Repeat with 2nd dough. Brush the top edges of the dough with a little olive oil, which gives the crust a beautiful sheen. Fill each pizza with 1/2 of the cheese (about 2 cups/8 oz per pizza), then the pepperoni and bacon or your desired toppings. Pour about 1 and 1/4 cups (300ml) of sauce evenly on top of each. If you do not like that much sauce, you can reduce to 3/4 cup (180ml) per pizza and have leftover sauce. Sprinkle each with 1/4 cup (22g) of grated parmesan cheese.</li>
                <li>Place the cake pans on top of a large baking sheet, which will catch anything potentially spilling over the sides of the pans. (Nothing usually does.) Bake for 20-28 minutes or until the crust is golden brown. Feel free to loosely cover the pizzas with aluminum foil after the 15 minute mark to prevent any heavy browning and uneven baking. Remove the pizzas from the oven and allow to cool in the pans placed on a wire rack for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, slice, serve, and enjoy. Place any leftover pizza in an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 5 days.  Reheat leftovers in a 300°F (149°C) oven for 15-20 minutes or until hot.</li>

            <h1>Third Pizza Recipe</h1>
            <h2>Homemade Thin-Crust Pizza</h2>
            <img src="https://cdn.apartmenttherapy.info/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:eco,c_fit,w_730,h_913/k%2Farchive%2Fcb2e9502cd9da3468caa944e15527b19bce68a8e" alt="a delicious looking Homemade thin crust pizza" height="250px" width="250px">
            <p>The crust has the best texture: This crust has a nice bit of crunch, but it’s pliable enough to fold in half if required. The mild wheat flavor is a nice backdrop to whatever toppings you want to layer on top.</p>
            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>3/4 cup lukewarm water</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
                <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for kneading</li>
                <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons olive oil, divided</li>
                <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce</li>
                <li>1 to 2 cups shredded cheese: one or a combination of mozzarella, provolone, Parmesan, fontina, romano, or asiago cheese</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Arrange a rack in the bottom third of the oven, place a rimmed baking sheet on the rack, and heat the oven to 450°F. Meanwhile, make the dough.</li>
                <li>Pour 3/4 cup lukewarm water into a medium bowl. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon active dry yeast over the water, and let stand until the yeast is dissolved and foamy, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add 2 cups all-purpose flour and 3/4 teaspoon salt. Mix with a stiff spatula or wooden spoon until floury, shaggy dough forms. Turn the dough out onto a work surface and knead until it forms a smooth, slightly tacky ball that springs back when you poke it, 5 to 8 minutes. If the dough sticks to your hands like bubblegum, add a tablespoon of flour at a time until it’s easier to work with; avoid adding too much flour if possible.</li>
                <li>Cover the dough with the upside-down bowl or a clean kitchen towel and let sit while you prepare the pizza toppings, about 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Divide the dough into 2 equal pieces. Working with one piece of dough at a time, stretch or roll it into a thin, 10- to 12-inch round. Form from the middle of the dough outwards, using the heel of your hand to gently press and stretch the dough until it's about a 1/4-inch thick or less. For an extra-thin crust, roll it with a rolling pin. If the dough starts to shrink back, let it rest for 5 minutes and then try rolling again.</li>
                <li>Carefully remove the preheated baking sheet from the oven and place it upside down on a wire rack. Transfer the dough directly onto the upside-down baking sheet. Brush the dough with 1 teaspoon of the oil. Spread 1/4 cup sauce into a thin layer onto dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Sprinkle on the cheese and other toppings.</li>
                <li>Bake until the crust is golden-brown and the cheese is melted and browned in spots, 8 to 12 minutes. Remove the pizza from the oven and cool for about 5 minutes before slicing and serving. Repeat with the remaining dough and toppings.</li>
            </ol>
